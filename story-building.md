# Story Building Workshop

## "Let's get to know each other" questions

1. Who are you? Tell me about yourself?
1. What have you been up to lately?
1. Why are you changing careers?
1. Why should we hire you?
1. Why are you an engineer?

* _5mins_: Judy and Punit model the interview
* _10-15mins_: solo work! first pass/brain dump at answering
* _15mins_: break into small groups! all folks read out answers, give feedback
* _10-15mins_: make any edits you'd like
* _10mins_: everyone present! hotseat peer interviewing

### Intention:

- becoming aware of your strengths
- having a strong positive pitch about yourself
- building a unique and authentic story: **stand out**
- knowing how to talk about the guild
- building confidence and being prepared
- getting good at delivery of answers

# Next steps
After we've developed our personal stories, we'll work on behavioral interviewing techniques.
